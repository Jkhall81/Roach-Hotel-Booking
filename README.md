# Roach Hotel Booking Project

This is a fullstack application build with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, typescript, Next Auth, and Sanity as a backend / CMS. This is the second time I have worked with Sanity. It is very fast and convenient, but doesn't offer the customization options that working with something like Django offers. Sanity is also very easy to use.

This features OAUTH login via a google or github account. There is a user already set up if you wish to login using credentials:

username: MistyH@gmail.com
password: password123
